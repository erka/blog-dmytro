# excalidraw-exporter

The tool is used to convert Excalidraw diagrams to SVG for this blog. It is based on:

- [excalidraw CLI #1261](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/1261) a long-running feature request to implement a CLI for Excalidraw
- [https://www.npmjs.com/package/excalidraw_export](excalidraw_export) a nice package that does almost all I need (except dark and light themed generation and bumped scale)
