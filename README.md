## Web Fonts

Typekit is used for loading external fonts. Font families currently used on the site:

- "Calluna" serif family with discretionary ligatures enabled is used in headers.

## Syntax highlighting

The blog fully supports user preferred dark/light theme. To support syntax highlighting, two color schemes are generated:

```bash
./scripts/generate_syntax.sh
```

This command will update `themes/kpumuk/assets/syntax.css` with syntax colors for both light and dark themes.
